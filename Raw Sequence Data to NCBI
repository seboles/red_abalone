## Log into transfer port c11-42
```ssh -p 2022 seboles@farm.cse.ucdavis.edu```
## cd into the directory containing raw sequence files
```cd /home/seboles/abaloneraw/ABALONERAWSEQ/RAWLANE4```
## ftp into NCBI
```ftp -p ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov```
## username & password provided to you once you have are at step 6 (Files) of the SRA  
## Once in follow follow the ftp directions provided 
## In my case
```cd uploads/seboles@ucdavis.edu_it3tadFE```
## You will need to create a new directory to transfer the files
```mkdir redabalone_rawseq```
## cd into the directory you made
```cd redabalone_rawseq```
## This turns the interactive mode off so you do not have type 'yes' for every file.
```prompt```
```mput *.fastq.gz```

## Trying again with the old prompts bc that is what NCBI says to do... I guess. I don't think she actually read my email. She just sent me a generic response.

## Re-Try to Upload to NCBI
## Lane 4
## cd into directory with raw sequence files
```cd /home/seboles/abaloneraw/ABALONERAWSEQ/RAWLANE4```
## ftp into the folder containing the .fastq files
