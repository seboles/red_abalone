#The space before ```--``` was not the solution to my problem of dignorm not being able to find my orhpan files. I am going to try to ```cat``` my orphan files again. 

#Here is the script for combining the orphans again. It worked, the file has data in it. I am going to try running the diginorm job again. 
```cat /home/seboles/abaloneraw/DataLane4/FemaleLane4/TRIM/orphanslane4female.fq.gz /home/seboles/abaloneraw/DataLane5/RawLane5/FemaleLane5/TRIMFEMALE5/orphanslane5female.fq.gz > orphanslane4lane5female.fq.gz```
