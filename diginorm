## DigiNorm Lane 4 and Lane 5 Female Trouble-Shooting

#I keep getting an error message that my orphan file is empty. The orphan files for lane 4 and lane 5 were combined using a soft link. I check to make sure the files contain data and they do. So then I made a new folder called 'orhpans'in the '/home/seboles/abaloneraw/CombinedLane4Lane5FemaleDigi/' to see if having the orphans in a different directory than the paired end (PE) files might make it easier for the software to find the data.
