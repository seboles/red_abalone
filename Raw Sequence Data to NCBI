```cd /home/seboles/abaloneraw/ABALONERAWSEQ/RAWLANE4```
```ftp ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov```
```subftp```
``` w4pYB9VQ```
```cd uploads/seboles@ucdavis.edu_it3tadFE```
```cd redabalone_rawseq```
```mput *.fastq.gz```

## Re-Try to Upload to NCBI
## Lane 4
## cd into directory with raw sequence files
```cd /home/seboles/abaloneraw/ABALONERAWSEQ/RAWLANE4```
## ftp into the folder containing the .fastq files
```ftp ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov```
## Username
```subftp```
## Password
``` w4pYB9VQ```
## Once in the directory containing the files cd into my folder at NIH
```cd uploads/seboles@ucdavis.edu_it3tadFE```
```cd redabalone_rawseq```
```prompt```
```mput *.fastq.gz```
