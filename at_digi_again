##Update: My ```.keep``` files are being sent to the same location that my slurm.out's are sent. This must be bc I removed the command to CD in DIGINORM.
##I am trying this tweek to the command as it was in the original script that Lisa gave me a long time ago. I hope this works. 

```#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -J DIGINORM_job
#SBATCH -t 72:00:00
#SBATCH -p high
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4

PROJECTROOT=/home/seboles/abaloneraw/CombinedLane4Lane5FemaleDigi/
DIGINORM=/home/seboles/abaloneraw/CombinedLane4Lane5FemaleDigi/DigiOut/
normalize-by-median.py -p -k 20 -C 20 -M 4e9 \
--savegraph $DIGINORM/normC20k20.ct -u \ orphans.fq.gz \
$PROJECTROOT/*.pe.qc.fq.gz```
