## I need to update my Ruby software. So do this line by line. 
```mkdir ~/bin```
```cd ~/bin/```
```curl -# "http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.17.tar.xz" -o "wget.tar.xz"```
```tar xf wget.tar.xz```

```./configure --with-ssl=openssl -with-libssl-prefix=/usr/local/ssl && make -j8 && make install```
```ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

## Go the directory where I want my files located. In this case, I want to copy them to the Element hardrive
```cd /Volumes/```

```cd Elements/```
