### This is how I log into xsede bridges through my terminal
```ssh abalone@login.xsede.org```
##Then I enter my xsede password into the terminal to get into the single sign on hub

### Once I enter the command above, I will be prompted via the "Duo" app on my phone to confirm my identity

###Once logged into the xsede through

```gsissh bridges```

### To get into my directory on bridges through my terminal 
```cd /pylon5/bi4ifup/abalone/male_assembly```
```ssh abalone@129.114.104.95```
### This is the error message that I get when I try to boot my jetstream instance from my terminal
ssh: connect to host 129.114.104.95 port 22: Connection refused
[abalone@br018 male_assembly]$ ssh abalone@129.114.104.95

## Now load the required modules for assembly
```module load trinity/2.4.0
module load bowtie2
module load gcc
module load samtools
Trinity --left maleleft.fq --right maleright.fq --seqType fq --max_memory 250G --CPU 32```
 
 ## Easiest to make sure that I am in the directory that contains my files. 
```scp filename jetstreamusername@instance address:~/``` this is will send it to my jet stream instance.

[abalone@br018 male_assembly]$ ssh abalone@129.114.104.95
