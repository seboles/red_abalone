## When I ran Trinity, there was a line of code that `rm` the necessary files for DESeq2, so I had to figure out how to splice the files together in order to move forward with DESEq. Here is what I did.

## In the `cd` to the `dir` containing the Trinity.fasta file
```cd /home/seboles/abaloneraw/CombinedDigiLane4Lane5Lane6FemaleDigi/Trinity```
## Create nano text file containing the following perl script and name it `myscript.pl`

```#!/usr/bin/env perl
#SBATCH -J gene_trans_map
#SBATCH -t 50:00:00
#SBATCH -p high
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=24
use strict;
use warnings;

while (<>) {
    if (/>(\S+)/) {
        my $acc = $1;
        if ($acc =~ /^(.*c\d+_g\d+)(_i\d+)/) {
            my $gene = $1;
            my $trans = $1 . $2;

            print "$gene\t$trans\n";
        }
        elsif ($acc =~ /^(.*comp\d+_c\d+)/) {
            my $gene = $1;
            my $trans = $acc;
            print "$gene\t$trans\n";
        }
        else {
            print STDERR "WARNING: cannot decipher accession $acc\n";
        }
    }
}

exit(0);
```
## In the same `dir` containing the fasta files, enter this command

```perl  myscript.pl  redabalonefemale_trinity_out.Trinity.fasta >  gene-trans-map.txt```
